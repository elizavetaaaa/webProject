  <!--Text about Queen-->
  <div id="queen" class="container text-center">
  <h3 >THE QUEEN</h3>
  <p   class="stText">Queen was a British rock band that formed in London in 1970. It was one of the most commercially successful music acts of all time. The band members were Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (guitar, vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals), and John Deacon (bass guitar).

Freddie Mercury died of an AIDS-related pneumonia on November 24, 1991. In 1997 John Deacon retired to spend more time with his family. The other two former members toured with Paul Rodgers from 2005 to 2009. In December 2018 it was announced Queen & Lambert will bring its Rhapsody Tour to The Forum in 2019. Three of their biggest hits were "We Will Rock You", "We Are the Champions" and "Bohemian Rhapsody".<br>

People often think that rock stars dedicate their whole life to music and hence are not much good in studies. A big blow to such misconception is the Queen Band. Except Freddie Mercury, every other band member has a post graduate degree. So, the Queen is actually pretty smart. It’s ok Freddi, that is not why they made you the lead singer; you are actually good! A degree doesn’t make you smarter, but educated.

Queen was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001.</p>

        <h4 class="modal-title">Bryan May</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
        <p>Brian May is widely acknowledged as one of the most influential, innovative, technically gifted and recognisable guitarists in the history of rock. He is also a prolific songwriter, responsible for writing or co-writing many international hits with Queen. He was educated at Hampton Grammar School in London. He then graduated with a degree in Maths and Physics from one of Britain's top universities, Imperial College London.

As a child, May built his own guitar with his father, partly out of an old fireplace. Unusually, the guitar was designed to feedback. He formed the band Smile while at university with drummer Roger Taylor. They were later joined by flamboyant singer and pianist Freddie Mercury, who renamed the band Queen. The addition of bass player John Deacon completed the line-up of a band which would go on to become one of the most successful in the history of popular music. May's guitar playing would become an integral part of Queen's sound.

May was influenced as a guitarist by the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page, who had dazzled audiences with their technical skills and volume, but he was also an admirer of the melodic skills of George Harrison of The Beatles and the original British rock and roll guitar hero, Hank B. Marvin of The Shadows.

What made May stand out as a guitarist was his combination of virtuoso technique but also melodic awareness. Unlike some virtuosos, who only play to showcase their ability, May always played to serve the songs. If a song only required minimal soloing, that's all he would do. His multi-tracking of guitar solos has also made him one of the most unique sounding guitarists in the world. Nowhere was this better exemplified than on Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody", the song which came to define the band more than any other and has become one of the most celebrated recordings in the history of rock music. May's solos are a big part of what gives the track its enduring appeal and emotional power.

May's legacy in music history is assured. He will be remembered along with the likes of George Harrison, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page as one of the most important and influential guitarists to come out of England. His songs for Queen were often their harder rock tracks, such as "We Will Rock You", "Tie Your Mother Down" and "Hammer to Fall", but he also wrote emotional songs such as "Save Me" and the symphonic "Who Wants to Live Forever", which proved his versatility as a songwriter.</p>

        <h4 class="modal-title1">Freddie Mercury</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body1">
        <p class="fr">Freddie Mercury was a singer-songwriter and musician whose music reached the top of U.S. and British charts in the 1970s and 1980s. As the frontman of Queen, Mercury was one of the most talented and innovative singers of the rock era. Born Farrokh Bulsara in Tanzania, Mercury studied piano in boarding school in India, then befriended numerous musicians at London's Ealing College of Art. <br>


When Freddie Mercury was born, he was named Farrokh Bulsara as he belonged to an Indian family from Gujarat. But later when he was studying in a boarding school, he adopted the name Freddie Mercury. Strangely his name in the passport is Fredrick Mercury. <br>
Mercury's parents, Bomi and Jer Bulsara, lived in India and were Parsees, or followers of the Zoroastrian religion whose ancestors came from Persia. After Bomi and Jer married, they moved to Zanzibar, Tanzania, where Bomi worked as a cashier for the British government's High Court. <br>
By the way,Freddie Mercury had designed the famous emblem of ‘Queen’ himself. His degree in art and graphic helped him to design this beautiful emblem. Even though he had claimed that he does not believe in anything related to astrology, yet his emblem consists of a Western star sign of the four members of the band.<br>Mercury died of AIDS-related bronchial pneumonia on November 24, 1991, at age 45.</p>

        <h4 class="modal-title2">Roger Taylor</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body2">
        <p class="fr">Roger Meddows Taylor (born 26 July 1949) is an English musician who performs as a multi-instrumentalist, singer and songwriter. He is best known as the drummer of the rock band Queen, but has also served as songwriter and occasional lead vocalist.<br>

As a songwriter, Taylor contributed songs to Queen's albums from the very beginning, composing at least one track on every album, and often singing lead vocals on his own compositions. He wrote or co-wrote three UK number 1s ("These Are the Days of Our Lives", "Innuendo" and "Under Pressure") and contributed a further major hits ("Radio Ga Ga", "A Kind of Magic","One Vision", "Heaven for Everyone", "Breakthru", and "The Invisible Man"). In addition to his drum work, Taylor routinely played keyboards, guitars and bass on his own songs. During the 1980s, in addition to his work with Queen, he formed a parallel band known as The Cross, in which he was the lead singer and rhythm guitarist. Taylor is also well-known for his falsetto vocal range.<br>

By the time Queen's album 'News of the World' was released in 1977, Taylor had met his future girlfriend, Dominique Beyrand, who was working for Richard Branson at the time, who was at the helm of Queen's free concert at Hyde Park. They lived together from 1980 to 1987, raising their two children: actor Felix Taylor and doctor Rory Eleanor Taylor. They decided to get married for reasons relating to his estate, to protect his children's interests in the future. At the time, Taylor was seeing another girl, model/actress Deborah Leng, the Cadbury's Flake girl also seen in Queen's "Breakthru" video; he moved in with her a month after his marriage of convenience to Beyrand. Before Freddie Mercury's death, Taylor and Leng had their first child, drummer Rufus Taylor, who was born in March 1991. He ended up having two more children with Leng: models Tigerlily Taylor (1994) and Lola Leng-Taylor (2000). In late 2002, they decided to break up.<br>

Taylor remarried on 26 August 2010, to Sarina Taylor. He resides in Guildford, Surrey, but also has a home in Helford, Cornwall. Her younger half-sister is fashion model Genevieve Potgieter.</p>

        <h4 class="modal-title3">John Deacon</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body3">
	    <p >Queen was comprised of some colorful characters, 		but the group's quiet and reserved bassist, John Deacon was an exception. Although he would often remain in the background, Deacon proved to be as talented as his bandmates when it came to songwriting, and he penned some of the band's biggest hits. Born on August 19, 1951 in Leicester, England, Deacon began playing the guitar in the early '60s before joining his first band, Opposition, in 1965. The following year, he switched to the bass guitar, and the group changed their name to the New Opposition (and a few years later, the Art). In late 1970, Deacon caught an early gig by Queen at a nearby college, yet left unimpressed. A few months later, he was introduced to Queen's drummer, Roger Taylor, who convinced the bassist to try out for the band, which led to his joining in January 1971. Queen signed a recording contract with EMI shortly thereafter, but it wouldn't be until 1973 that they would release their self-titled debut (on which the bassist is listed as Deacon John). It would take Deacon a few releases before he began to contribute songs to the group, but the wait was worth it, as he subsequently wrote (or co-penned) such Queen classics as "Stone Cold Crazy," "You're My Best Friend" (a worldwide hit), and "Spread Your Wings." Deacon's crowning songwriting achievement would come on Queen's 1980 release, The Game, an album which saw the band experiment with a variety of musical styles and sounds (the first release on which synthesizers were permitted to be used).

			Deacon had long wanted to write a song that was in the style of funk/disco, and he more than delivered with "Another One Bites the Dust," an infectious, bass-propelled ditty that went on to become one of the year's biggest crossover hits. He continued to pen songs for Queen ("Need Your Loving Tonight," the U.K. hit "I Want to Break Free," "Friends Will Be Friends," etc.), and also began playing with others. A few of these extracurricular recording sessions resulted in a one-off single, "Picking Up Sounds," recorded by the obscure supergroup Man Friday & Jive Junior (which featured Scott Gorham, Simon Kirke, Martin Chambers, and Mick Ralphs), a pair of Elton John albums (1985's Ice on Fire and 1986's Leather Jackets), plus releases by Anita Dobson, Cozy Powell, and solo albums by all three of his fellow Queen bandmates. In 1986, Deacon was supposedly ready to launch his own side project, the Immortals, but aside from an obscure single, "No Turning Back," nothing was ever heard from the band again. Following Queen leader Freddie Mercury's death in 1991, Deacon kept a low profile (perfectly content with leading the family life), although he did reappear with his fellow surviving bandmates at an all-star tribute to Mercury in 1992. Deacon also supplied bass to a few unfinished tracks that Mercury left behind before his death, which were finished off and issued under the title of Made in Heaven in 1995. Deacon has subsequently retired from the music business entirely, failing to even show up with his Queen bandmates at the 2001 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony. </p>

  <h3 >Queen's music</h3>
	  <strong id="strong">“Recording our first album, we were all just students finishing our degrees.”
	Brian May</strong>
  <p   class="stText">Queen's debut album was recorded in London between 1971 and 1972 at Trident Studios and De Lane Lea studios. All but one of the tracks were produced by Queen, Roy Baker and Trident's resident producer John Anthony, with The Night Comes Down instead produced by the band and Louie Austin at De Lane Studios. The engineers for the sessions were Roy Baker, Mike Stone, Ted Sharpe and David Hentschel.

	The cover artwork was devised by Brian, Freddie and photographer friend Douglas Puddifoot and is based upon a shot taken on stage by Puddifoot during an early Queen concert. The band members thought the image of Freddie performing beneath a lone spot-light was an appropriate cover for the first album.

	This album saw the beginning of the famous 'Nobody played synths' note, which was to become such a familiar aspect of all Queen LPs right up to 1980's The Game. The band were fed up with people mistaking their elaborate multi-tracking and innovative guitar effects for synthesizers, when in fact much of the sound was created by Brian on his guitar using the band's own equipment and pioneering recording techniques - including the John designed 'Deacy amp' which is still used to this day.

	The famous Queen Crest logo seen on the back of the first album was designed by Freddie around this time, and became a familiar sight on most of the band's product.

	Queen was released on July 13th 1973 in the UK and attained Gold sales status. In America it was issued in September, with a revised pink cover replacing the usual purple one, and also reached Gold sales.</p>
